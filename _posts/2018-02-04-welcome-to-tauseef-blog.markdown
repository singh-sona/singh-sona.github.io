First of all, Thank you for stopping by.

# Who am I?
Hi, I am `Sonali Singh`, a *Data Analyst Intern* and a *Creativity Enthusiast* from Binghamton, NY who loves to build model on datasets to build great products and help business succeed with their goals. 

I was born in Nainital, India and travelled to the United States for my masters program in System Science and Industrial Engineering from [Binghamton University][https://www.binghamton.edu/] and recently been awarded with academic excellence recongnition...yaay!

I have over 3 years rich  professional experience in multiple industries of manufacturing, software and health. I am aspiring to learn, grow and share the knowledge. I started real world problem solving and delivering solutions from the year 2014, since then I have come far and learnt a lot. I am constantly looking to work on exciting projects.

#### I believe in the statement -
> "All models are wrong but some are useful"


# What is this site about?
Starting a blog and creating an online presense, to share my learnings was always on my to do list. Finally today I decided to start doing it.
I want to use this site as a place to share my experiences with interesting programing problem solving, hoping someone will benefit from the findings.

Happy Analyzing!
